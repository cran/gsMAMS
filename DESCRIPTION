Description: It provides functions to generate operating characteristics and to calculate Sequential Conditional Probability Ratio Tests(SCPRT) efficacy and futility boundary values along with sample/event size of Multi-Arm Multi-Stage(MAMS) trials for different outcomes. The package is based on Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li, Liang Zhu (2023) <doi:10.1002/sim.9682>, Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li (2023) "Group Sequential Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Survival Trial Design with Treatment Selection"(Manuscript accepted for publication) and Jianrong Wu, Yimei Li, Shengping Yang (2023) "Group Sequential Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Trial Design with Ordinal Endpoints"(In preparation).
